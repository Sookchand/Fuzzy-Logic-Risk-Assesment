# Fuzzy Logic Risk Assesment

This is a solution to a project risk assessment problem using Fuzzy Logic. The problem is solved using scikit-fuzzy, a Python library for fuzzy logic. The solution uses linguistic variables for antecedents and consequents, and membership functions for each linguistic value. The rules are then defined and a control system is created. The inputs are then passed to the control system and the output is computed.

## Lessons Learned
- Fuzzy logic can be used to solve problems where a precise answer is not possible. 
- It is also useful for problems where there is uncertainty or ambiguity. 
- Fuzzy logic can be used to make decisions based on multiple inputs.
